# PanGEM Toolbox
The PanGEM Toolbox is intended to aid in the reconstruction of a pangenome scale metabolic network model, and in the retrieval of stoichiometrically balanced, feasible reconstructions for each strain therein. PanGEM Toolbox is intended for use with the Microbial Simulation Environment [MSE](https://github.com/jrcasey/mse_AMT), but the SBML models generated can be used with other systems biology tools. The user may need to implement changes and updates if they intend on running this pipeline for a new taxonomic group. Otherwise, the distribution is currently set up to run a demonstration with 649 strains of *Prochlorococcus*. 

The workflow has been broken up into 7 sequential steps (described below). Unfortunately, due to storage and file size limits on GitHub, several files were not able to be provided here. They are:

1. chem_xref.txt - an link identifier database from MetaNetX, used for annotating metabolites. This can be downloaded from [here](https://www.metanetx.org/mnxdoc/mnxref.html).
2. Assembly\_L1\_[YYYYMMDD] - The level 1 assembly generated by PanGEM Toolbox in Step 2. Running the script will generate this file for you locally (takes about 10 minutes on my machine).
3. Genomes must be downloaded either (a) from a static repository (see below) or (b) directly from IMG, NCBI, etc. If you intend to build a PanGEM from scratch (e.g., for another taxonomic group), you will need (b), of course. Download [this zipped directory on Zenodo](http://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.4477905) containing all *Prochlorococcus* genomes used in this tutorial to `data/genomes/IMG_Dump`

Dependencies: [RAVEN 2.0](https://github.com/SysBioChalmers/RAVEN/wiki), [Mosek 9](https://www.mosek.com/downloads/).

### Getting Started
1. Clone the mse_AMT repository to a local directory: `git clone https://github.com/jrcasey/mse_AMT`
2. In Matlab, add the repository to the path: `addpath(genpath(~/path/to/PanGEM/` and navigate to the directory `cd ~/path/to/PanGEM/`
3. Follow the sequence of steps in the folder `/StepByStep`.
4. Please contact [me](https://jrcasey.github.io/) with questions or comments!
